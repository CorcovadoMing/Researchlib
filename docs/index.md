# Welcome to ResearchLib

General purpose Deep Learning Framework on top of PyTorch

ResearhLib focuses on **high-level** abstraction for Deep Learning applications without worrying about the details engineering, suitable for using neural network as building blocks for complex application. We also leveraged on several recent tricks and optimized for speed. We aim to make the neural network cool again! Everyone can do Deep Learning on ResearchLib.
